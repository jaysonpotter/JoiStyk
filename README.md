JoiStyk
=======

*View a demo of [JoiStyk](http://projects.jaysonpotter.com)!*

Saturday March 9, 2013 : 
This is a working prototype of an HTML5 canvas joystick with some key features. 
* Can be used on mouse or touch event driven devices
* JoiStyk is visible when the user is interacting with the canvas, and gone when the user is not
* JoiStyk will adjust to when the user has gone farther than the initial bounds of the pad area.
* Basic output of X and Y coords

Some things I'll be adding to JoiStyk are : 
* plugin-ify-ing JoiStyk
* update output from just text outputs to real returns
* a circular joystick pad collision area in which JoiStyk will be bound to, just a box now
* the ability to use images instead of circles
* color controls
* add velocity to how JoiStyk follows the pointer
